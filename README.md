# Fox and Hound

A public reupload of the Fox and Hounds game developed for a Year 12 software assignment, completed in February 2023.

The graphics used in the game are rendered through the writing of ascii characters to the command line and include the use of ANSII codes in order to optimise the player experience. The program is written entirely in C and demonstrates both high level programming concepts such as user input and lower level concepts such as bit manipulation in order to execute the game comfortably even on significantly lower capability hardware.
